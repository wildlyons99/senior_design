# Perceptron Verilog Project

This project contains the Verilog implementation of a perceptron, a type
of artificial neural network that is being used for binary classification 
of ones and zeros. Below is a description of the files in this folder and 
instructions on how to run the build script.

This project was designed to run on the Lattice iCE405kUP

These files mostly attempt to replicate the behavior of the vhdl module
perceptron_2. 
Notable differences: 
- v3 attempts to perform all 16 multiply operations simulatiniously
  TODO - Change this to replicate final behavior, using only one DSP 
  to perform multiply accumulate. 
  TODO - use MAC16 component 
  (I think do both of these in a v4)
- Attemps to fix 16 bit activation function error
- rom.v uses a readmem verilog function to read the data from a file
  into memory instead of listing the contents in the RDL 
- In verilog instead of VHDL
- AS OF MY MOST RECENT TEST DOES NOT CLASSIFY CORRECTLY

## Files
`top.v`:        
    The top module for this function - module perceptron_v3
    Generates 16 multiply modules that perform multiplications 
     at the same time
    Contains and connects mult module, to activation function, and sevenseg 
    Performs the sum of products and adds the bias

`mult.v`: 
    Perform multiplication on rising edge of clock 

`activation.v`:
    Returns the result of our (potentially flawed) activation function
    Asyncronous

`seven_seg.v`:
    Mapping to sevensegment display

`rom.v`:
    Loads the ROM Image Data into memory

`rom_data.mem`:
    The Image Data


## How to Run the Build Script
To run: 
    sh build.sh perceptron

To clean directory: 
    sh clean.sh

## Requirements

- Install the open source OSS_CAD_SUITE
- A .pcf file with the assigned pin mappings
- A iCE405kUP attached VIA USB

Note: 
Windows support not currently documented

### Installing OSS-CAD-SUITE For Macs
Install: oss-cad-suite-darwin-arm64-20241214.tgz from: 
https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases/tag/2024-12-14

Go to wherever you installed the file, and run ./activate to to allow 
execution of quarantined files

Edit your terminal configuration file to include the path. You can run 
“echo $SHELL” to see what shell you use in the terminal. 

For example to add to your ZSHRC path:
nano .zshrc
export PATH="<extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/bin:$PATH"

After this, you should be all set to run the script! 
(You should also have GHDL installed locally!)
